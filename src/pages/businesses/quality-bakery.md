  There are many concerns around Covid 19 virus, and I wish to assure you that
  we are taking every precaution available to ensure the safety of our customers
  and employees. The storefront is being sanitized on a regular basis. Employees
  are instructed to wash their hands every ten minutes. Product going out of the
  bakery to our wholesale customers is placed in clean clear plastic bags before
  it is placed in boxes to be ready for delivery. The van in which the product
  is delivered is sanitized before and after each delivery.
